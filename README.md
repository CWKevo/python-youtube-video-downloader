# Python mass YouTube video downloader

### [!] This project is for educational purposes only!

So, I was bored and made a bulk YouTube video downloaded that fetches YouTube video data from https://subscriptions.gir.st/

1. First, paste YouTube video URLs/codes in video_urls.txt
2. Then run download.py. All videos will be downloaded in the "saved_videos" directory (you might need to create it).

**Requires:** [requests](https://pypi.org/project/requests/) & Python ^3.6 (tested on 3.9.1 Windows 10 64-bit & Ubuntu 20.4 LTS, I can't guarantee that this will work for you)
